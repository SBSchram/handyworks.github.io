                <div class="post-excerpt">The ability to reach out to a patient through a text message was just added to HandyWorks, thanks to the encouragement of Dr. Timothy W. We are able to do this with the help of clicksend.com, a large and well supported web business that provides the actual sending software. Messages cost 2.5 cents each if they are under 160 characters and there is a monthly fee of $1.68. Over the last 2 months, we have been refining the process to make it even easier to use. GIVE IT A TRY! To set this up, first use this link to create a handyworks linked account. After you have an account, get a TFN verified number. Download and run ClickSend to get clicksend.txt into your c:\hww folder Open file explorer to the HWW folder and DoubleClick the clicksend.txt file to edit it Put in your information replacing the sample data. That&#x27;s it! The link from the patient data screen will now become active and usable.</div>

In older versions of HW, we provided a utility to transform one carrier to another, but this is slow and tedious when there might be a dozen or so more to transform. So we enhanced the conversion process by providing a change from list box that lets you select more than one carrier at a time to transform. Simply select with your mouse which carriers need to be transformed and then select what to transform into. Green to go, as usual. Confirmation for each change is still required. In the same vein, we have added a similar feature to procedure codes. This lets you get rid of old codes by transforming them, in bulk into newer codes.</div>

We fixed the graphing issue in the new statistics module so it presents a better bell curve. We added some code to electronic billing that allows the ansi ebill creation to follow the HCFA preferences rule for filling box 32A.
