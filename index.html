                <p class="post-date">2024-08-08</p>                <div class="post-excerpt">The ability to reach out to a patient through a text message was just added to HandyWorks, thanks to the encouragement of Dr. Timothy W. We are able to do this with the help of clicksend.com, a large and well supported web business that provides the actual sending software. Messages cost 2.5 cents each if they are under 160 characters and there is a monthly fee of $1.68. Over the last 2 months, we have been refining the process to make it even easier to use. GIVE IT A TRY! To set this up, first use this link to create a handyworks linked account. After you have an account, get a TFN verified number. Download and run ClickSend to get clicksend.txt into your c:\hww folder Open file explorer to the HWW folder and DoubleClick the clicksend.txt file to edit it Put in your information replacing the sample data. That&#x27;s it! The link from the patient data screen will now become active and usable.</div>
