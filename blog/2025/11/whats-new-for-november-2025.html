<li><strong>Website:</strong> We did a complete rebuild after our old version decided to quit working. The site actually was fine except users could no longer download our updates. For a while we hosted the files elsewhere, but now, hopefully, everything is hunky-dory!</li>
<li><strong>Billing:</strong> A few users were having problems with certain Medicaid requirements. A few twists and turns later and voila – it's working. Thanks Dr. Tim!</li>
<li><strong>That's all for 2025 – Happy Handyworking.</strong></li>
