Over the last few months, we have experienced ceaseless robo-fax calls from many different places to our 800 line, resulting in 100's of hang-up fax calls on a near daily basis. Not only was this annoying in and of itself, but having to delete countless screeching messages became a time-consuming and useless chore. Adding to the misery was the racking up of bogus phone charges.

"Enough" we said!

So the 800# is no more.
