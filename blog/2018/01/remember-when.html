This is from our archives. I think 1985. Our first DOS version. It all fit on a 1.2 meg floppy disk. We originally developed this on a Kaypro machine that had a 10meg hard drive. The first installation was in Atlnata, at the office of Dr. Gene Sparlin, closely followed by our.second installation in the office of Dr. Dan Sullivan. From there, we jumped to NY in 1984 where HandyWorks was rewritten from the ground up.

Mailing out disks and updates was quite a chore back then, prior to the internet.  Our first website, captured by the wayback machine is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981201182128/https://www.handyworks.com:80/Default.htm">here</a>.
