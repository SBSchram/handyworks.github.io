Over the years, many users have asked if we could resize the screen and make it bigger. We always replied that we couldn't do this and that the only way to do this was through the computers resolution setting. But now, we are adding the ability to RESIZE your HW screens. We have currently done this for the Appointment Book, but if you think other forms need resizing, just let us know.
