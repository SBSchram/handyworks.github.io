<h3>Stuff about Statements</h3>

<p>We recently corrected and issue with the printing of the first date on a statement. This worked quite well on "normal" statements, but payment only statements did not print any dates because the payment was not usually the first item in a visit. That's Been Fixed.</p>
<p>At the same time we were testing the payment only Statement, we noticed that when we did a payments only Statement, that the end of day report was stuck on the payments only as well. That's Been Fixed.</p>
<p>Then when testing finance charges, we found another problem of it not printing the number in the correct column. That's Been Fixed. </p>
<p>A long time user needed 99 (other) for the place of service. That's Been Fixed.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
