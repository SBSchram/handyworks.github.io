<h2>Going out on a first date?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One really nagging issue has been the printing of the first transaction dates on statements. Because we only want to show the first date in a transaction that has many services, we had code that would hide the subsequent dates. But, when the statement was viewed and then printed, the routine would "mess up" and hide all the dates on the first visit. Well that is now Fixed.</p>

<h2>A fix for the ERA</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some clearinghouses have begun making the ERA (Electronic Remittance Advice) "readable" by breaking up the lines. This actually made them harder to read by "machine". FTFY.</p>

<h2>Time will Tell!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A second improvement is on the appointment book. The time now displays on the top line.</p>
