<p>Also, we finally squashed a reporting bug that occurred when closing the program. It was happening when a record in case data was not saved. It was being automatically saved when the program closed, but a subsequent update function wouldn't work. All fixed now. No more error messages if colosing with an unsaved case data record.</p>
