<p>We added a new Monthly Stats report to break down how many distinct patient visits occurred each month. If a patient saw you 12 times, it would count as one patient visit. It will automatically run when you run the original Monthly Stats report.</p>
<p>The dropdown next patient visit dates on the calendar has been specifically ordered by date. Prior, it was ordered by date of entry, which appeared to be by date but actually wasn't. Also, the next appointment sheet given to patients now has the day of the week as part of that report. </p>
<p>Lastly, the SALT button in Exams was fixed to reflect the latest exam, not the earliest. </p>
