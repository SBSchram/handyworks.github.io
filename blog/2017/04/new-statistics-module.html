I've often wondered what my average patient visit count was. Standard deviation as well. We had something that did this in the original HW-DOS system from the early 80's but nothing in the ms access version. Sad.

<p>
Well, it coming soon to an update near you.
</p>
<p>
What an amazingly high standard deviation I have on my visit counts. That's because I have a hundreds of 1 or 2 visit wonders along with hundreds of patients with over a 100 visits. So it's not really a useful number for me. Maybe it will be different for you.
</p>
<p>
What is the average age of my patients? And Female/Male ratio as well.
</p>
<p>
The basic form is in place. The graphing is still under construction and may only available as a report rather than on screen..
</p>
<p>
Stay tuned...
