A few gentle fixes are included in the <a href="https://www.handyworks.com/download/">2/13/2017 update</a>. First is a fix in electronic bills, when there are multiple locations and a master billing clinic, the NPI number for the service location is left blank. The NPI for the billing provider and rendering provider are included. Secondly, the calculation of visit counts for Day Stats, when there were multiple clinics, was not totaling correctly. Lastly, there is new code in the Main Switchboard that will pick up if you are not running the proper version of HandyWorks for your program or for your HWDATA.
