Prior to this September update, if you had special margin settings for your reports, you would have to manually change them. From this point forward, HandyWorks will save these settings in a file on each machine. When a new upgrade is detected, HW will read those settings and restore your margin settings to what they used to be.

While we have streamlined the process of printer selection for ChargeItPro and X-Charge, these still have to be changed them manually.

<p>Please note that this upgrade will not work if you are (heaven forbid!) running MS Access 2000!</p>
