<ul>
<li>Finalized the interface in the duplicate patient merge module. No longer is it possible to do it wrong! - Thanks Eve</li>
<li>The "Authorized Through" report was asking for unneeded financial parameters (fixed) - Thanks Stu.</li>
<li>The automatic quit after 3 hours of inactivity was hanging on some machines (fixed!)</li>
<li>The zip code box in carriers was made a "tad" wider. (it was too small for zip+4)</li>
<li>The Upgrade link was fixed. And a redirect was set for the old website to handle older upgrades as well.</li>
<li>Printing or viewing the appointment calendar also creates a CSV file "MyAppointments.csv". This is for those of you brave enough to use an external reminder service.</li>
